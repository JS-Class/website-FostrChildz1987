            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I have grown up and lived in West Unity for all of my life. 
                    I attend Hilltop High School, graduating this year, but I have been enrolled in Northwest State Community College, full-time, since my Junior year of high school.
                    The degree that I am currently pursuing is Computer Programming, with a certificate in Cybersecurity.
                    After I obtain my associate's degree, I plan on transfering to Miami University to finish a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                </p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    My favorite hobby is playing video games. My favorite genre is competitive, as those types of games push you to get better at the game.<br>
                    I also enjoy writing code for recreation. I have developed a command-line version of Blackjack in Python, Java, and C++, and I am currently developing a GUI version in Python.
                    When I have access to a computer, <em>capable of not crashing when I even think of clicking on Unity</em>, I enjoy developing games. I have developed a Donkey Kong replica, which
                    was suppose to be an inside joke, but I have made attempts to optimize it into a legit game.
                </p>
            <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been on the Hilltop Golf Team since 7th grade.
                    I have also been a part of the Hilltop Archery Team since 6th grade.
                    I was a member of the Hilltop Esports Team from 2019 to 2022, and have been a member of the Northwest State Thunder esports team since Fall 2022.
                    I have also tried basketball and baseball, but they did not seem to resonate with me.
                </p>
